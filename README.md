# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor 

##Descirption 

- My motivation was to modify a starter code to make it more accessible for the client.
- The problems I found was existing elements like <div> goes in a big container making it difficult to find that group of elements  
- I used semantic HTML elements <nav> at the header <article> all the article elements and changed the </body> to the end of last article and the side bar I add element <aside> add cheang <div> to 
  <section> the end of the web i used <footer> </footer> can tell the next deverlopers this is the end of the page to improve it by makng it easier to read without changing what it does. 
- I also found ALT attributes were missing and I added them for future developers to understand what it is for in case that img link doesn't work so they have an idea of what it means.
- This helped me read, identify and organize code better.
