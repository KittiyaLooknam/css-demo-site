# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor 

##Descirption 

- My motivation was to modify a starter code to make it more accessible for the client.
- The problems I found was existing elements like <div> goes in a big container making it difficult to find that group of elements  
- I used semantic HTML elements <section> to improve it by makng it easier to read without changing what it does.
- I also found ALT attributes were missing and I added them for future developers to understand what it is for in case that img link doesn't work so they have an idea of what it means.
- This helped me read, identify and organize code better.
